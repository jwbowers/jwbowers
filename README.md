### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can see some of my open source projects on this personal github site.

**I also have open source projects on github via my [Lab Organization](https://github.com/bowers-illinois-edu).**

And I contribute to projects on the [EGAP github org](https://github.com/egap) and [the General Services Administration github org](https://github.com/GSA).

I am a co-author of [RItools](https://github.com/markmfredrickson/RItools). 

You can learn more about me on [my main website](https://jakebowers.org).
